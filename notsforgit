Create a new branch every day for your work. Move the newly created files into that branch.
Before creating a new branch, always check which branch you are creating it from.
Before committing changes, ensure you are in the correct branch.
After creating a new project, make sure the master/main branch has at least one file pushed to the repository.

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git config --global user.password "your_password"

✅ Prerequisites:
You have Git installed.

You have a GitHub account and a repository created.

Your VS project is not already a Git repository (if it is, skip git init).

📂 1. Navigate to your project folder
Open a terminal or Git Bash and run:

cd path/to/your/visual-studio-project
🔧 2. Initialize a git repository

git init
📁 3. Add all files

git add .
📝 4. Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit"
🌐 5. Add your GitHub remote URL
Go to GitHub, create a new repository (without initializing with README), then copy the repository URL and run:

For HTTPS:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
For SSH (if configured):

git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name.git
📤 6. Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main.
