Before committing changes, ensure you are in the correct branch.
After creating a new project, make sure the master/main branch has at least one file pushed to the repository.

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git config --global user.password "your_password"

cd path/to/your/visual-studio-project

2. Initialize a git repository
git init

3. Add all files
git add .

4. Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit"

 5. Add your GitHub remote URL
Go to GitHub, create a new repository (without initializing with README), then copy the repository URL and run:

For HTTPS:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
For SSH (if configured):

git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name.git
6. Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M master.
git push -u origin master.
